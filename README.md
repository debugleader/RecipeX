# RecipeX
RecipeX is a front-end **web application** that is built using React and React hooks to fetch recipes from an API and display them to the end user. It uses many technologies, and libraries like AOS, GSAP...

# Why?

Recipex is a collection of recipes, and information about the preparation and serving of foods. At its best, RecipeX is also a chronicle and treasury of the fine art of cooking, an art whose masterpieces—created only to be consumed—would otherwise be lost.

# How can I try it?

* Use the web hosted version.

# How?

It consumes the [Edamam recipe API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api), and outputs all the information in a designed way to the end user. While it's loading, I made  a loading div that shows up and disappears once the information is fetched, and I added some cool hover, animation features that I want you to discover! :wink:

> This application was initially built by Dev Ed in this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9T6YkEDkMo), I simply improved the application and added more design, animation, security, some styling, and more functionalities.
